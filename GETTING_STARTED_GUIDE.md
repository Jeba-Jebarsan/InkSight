# Getting Started with InkSight Tattoo Simulator

Welcome to InkSight! This guide will walk you through the complete process of using the Tattoo Simulator, from setting up your API key to generating your first AI-powered tattoo visualization.

## Step 1: Get Your API Key 🔑

To use the AI generation features, you need a Replicate API token.

1.  Go to [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/)
2.  **Sign up** or **Log in** with your GitHub account.
3.  Navigate to your [API Tokens page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
4.  Click **"Create token"** (give it a name like "InkSight").
5.  **Copy** the token (it starts with `r8_...`).

## Step 2: Set Up the API Key in the App ⚙️

1.  Open the InkSight application in your browser.
2.  Navigate to the **Simulator** page.
3.  You will see an **"Enter Your Replicate API Token"** box at the top.
4.  Paste your copied token (beginning with `r8_...`) into the input field.
5.  Click the **"Save"** button.
    *   *Note: Your token is stored locally in your browser for security and is never sent to our servers.*
    *   ✅ You'll see a green "API Connected" indicator once saved.

## Step 3: Upload Your Canvas (Image) 📸

1.  Look for the **"1. The Canvas"** section on the left.
2.  **Drag & Drop** a photo of yourself (or the body part you want to tattoo) into the upload box.
    *   *Tip: Use a clear, well-lit photo where the skin area is visible.*
3.  Alternatively, **click the box** to browse files on your device.
4.  Once uploaded, you can use the rotate/enhance tools to adjust your photo if needed.

## Step 4: Describe Your Vision 💭

1.  Scroll down to **"2. The Vision"**.
2.  **Concept**: Type a detailed description of the tattoo you want.
    *   *Example: "A realistic lion head with geometric shapes and roses"*
3.  **Style Preference**: Click on a style button that matches your idea (e.g., *Realism*, *Traditional*, *Minimalist*).
4.  **Placement (Optional)**:
    *   If you want to place the tattoo on a specific spot, select **"Custom Area"** under the image.
    *   Then, **click and drag** on your uploaded photo to draw a box where the tattoo should go.

## Step 5: Simulate & Experience ⚡

1.  Click the large **"SIMULATE PLACEMENT"** button.
2.  **Experience**:
    *   🔊 Listen for the realistic **tattoo machine buzzing sound**.
    *   ⏳ Watch the **"Inking in Progress"** overlay on the preview panel.
3.  Wait a few seconds for the AI to generate your design.

## Step 6: Review Artist Critique 🎨

Once the generation is complete:

1.  Look at the **"3. Preview"** panel on the right.
2.  Use the **Opacity Slider** to see how the tattoo blends with your skin.
3.  Read the **Artist Critique**:
    *   **Rating**: An AI-generated quality score (1-10).
    *   **Feedback**: Specific advice on your design concept.
    *   **Strengths & Considerations**: Pros and cons of your chosen location and style.

### Troubleshooting 🛠️

*   **API Error?** verify you copied the full token starting with `r8_`.
*   **Generation Failed?** Try a simpler prompt or a clearer photo.
*   **No Sound?** Ensure your lifting/device volume is on. (Note: Browsers require you to interact with the page first before playing audio).
